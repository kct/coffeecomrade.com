<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>Coffee Comrade is written by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">Bryan Matthew Warren</a>.</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>I write this weblog for several reasons, foremost of which to improve my communication skills and clarify my thoughts on coffee. I love coffee and the culture that surrounds it, but have an admittedly small working knowledge of the <em>vast</em> amount of intricacies.</p>

<p>I think Jeff Atwood skillfully summarized this notion in his <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/02/how-to-write-without-writing.html">article about the why's of writing</a>.</p>

<p>Importantly, I hope to inspire in readers a love of&ndash; and participation in&ndash; coffee culture without the common snobbery and heavy-handedness.</p>

<h3>Technical</h3>

<p>I don't use any server-side weblog software; I have no use for 90% of their features. Instead, I write articles in plain text, then everything is gussied-up into a static site via <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> with some help from the <a href="https://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext">jekyll_ext</a> wrapper and several <a href="https://github.com/rfelix/my_jekyll_extensions">extensions</a>.</p>

<p>For the truly curious, you can poke around in <a href="https://github.com/haircut/coffeecomrade.com">my source code on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I encourage you to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">contact me</a> with any feedback or questions. I don't offer a commenting system by choice, and Paul Ford's <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html">observations on the "Why Wasn't I Consulted?" problem</a> should explain that decision.</p>
