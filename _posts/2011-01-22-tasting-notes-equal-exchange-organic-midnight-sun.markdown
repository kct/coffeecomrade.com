I Grabbed this [dark roast from Equal Exchange][1] at the local co-op on sale.

Look at how oily these suckers are! They're practically dripping.
 
Brewed in my small Chemex, the finished product was decent, but lacking; so I moved on to the AeroPress. Using two tablespoons of beans–finely ground–produced a very tasty cup!

The aroma is thick with syrup, almost malty. The flavor is quite rich with absolutely no notes of fruit and a very heavy, bold coffee flavor. Its taste is rather simple. It feels heavy in the mouth with very low acidity. The crema is creamy and rich with oil. As I often experience–quite enjoyably–with dark roasts there is a subtle coconut aftertaste mixed with dark chocolate.
 
Midnight Sun is drinkable despite its fairly modest complexity. It lingers on the tongue _slighty_ too long and tastes exclusively of coffee. The flavor lacks nuance, as is common with the darkest roasts, but this is disappointing only if you're expecting a diverse flavor profile. This roast won't grab everyone, but those who enjoy their drink bold will find something to like.

### Verdict
 
Recommended _only_ if you _really_ like dark roasts. 2 Stars.
