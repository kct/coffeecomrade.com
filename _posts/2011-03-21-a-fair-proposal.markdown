Fairtrade International [announced a 100% price increase][1] for certified "fair trade" coffees beginning April 1st. An appropriate date to pick for such a shell game.

It's unfortunate that "fair trade" certification is a bit of a sham. Mainly designed for consumer guilt relief, there are no universal standards nor a single certifying agency that defines what exactly constitutes a fair trade. Sure, most certifying agencies negotiate living wages for farm workers and equitable pricing. That's great. But keep in mind that printing a fair trade logo (from any number of the myriad trade groups) on your package has a clear capitalistic motive: assure the consumer that your product is ethically better–and thus more worthy of purchase–than your competitor. 

There's also the licensing fees and annual dues. It costs money for both the grower and distributor to use be certified.

Further, setting a price floor on a commodity neglects free market principles. "Fair trade" makes no promise of quality and is a poor indicator of the economic viability of a crop. The coffee market is long established and is purely capitalistic (right, wrong or indifferent). Artificial price minimums on a subset of coffees encourages overproduction to leverage the higher prices. That increased supply drives down prices of non-fair-trade and can potentially worsen conditions on non-certified farms.

A lot of the argument for Fair Trade hinges on a false dichotomy that certified farms are _automatically_ ethical and those who opt out of certification are _automatically_ exploitative. That argument is a assumptive and a result of a marketing push to vilify growers who choose not to participate. In reality, Fair Trade minimum wages often wind up as _maximum_ wages (why pay more than what's required to goad consumers onto your team) and can be [lower than competing non-certified farms][2].

So what do you do? Research! Most roasters worth their salt will be happy, even _proud_ to give you an earful about the origins of their product. If their website doesn't provide enough information, call them!

If you're concerned about the economic implications of your caffeine habit, put in the legwork to find companies in line with your morals. Look into [direct trade][3] options and charities like [Coffee Kids][4].

But don't just jump onto a bandwagon based on a logo.
