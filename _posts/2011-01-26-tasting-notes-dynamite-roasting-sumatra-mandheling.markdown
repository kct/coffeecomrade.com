[Dynamite Roasting][1] cooks up beans in Black Mountain, NC. The organic roaster offers a wide variety of both blends and single-origin roasts.

The [Mandheling][2] beans are a medium roast that edge slightly toward dark. The aroma is deep and decidedly "brown" with strong punches of salt and earth. Yeah, "earth." In a good way.

Nut flavor is pervasive, held up by subtle wood and oil textures. There's a light hint of dark fruitâ€“maybe cherry or pomegranate. The brew feels very thin and almost weightless. While this may seem like a reflection of poor body, the finished cup has an excellent build that allows the light weight to shine through.

I could drink this stuff all day. The aftertaste is just right; it doesn't overstay its welcome. Surprisingly, the cup smells precisely as delicious as the grounds. This almost never happens. It's an honest roast.

### Verdict
Dynamite Roasting's __Sumatra Mandheling__ is a real workhorse. It's a general-purpose roast that works just as well in a drip pot as in espresso drinks. Several local joints keep this in their air pots. It's good that way, but loses a lot of complexity. Brewed any other way, this roast is exceedingly excellent.

My review may not have reflected this, but I'm trying to show a bit of restraint. Dynamite's Indonesian offering is my favorite coffee. No hyperbole. 5 Stars.
