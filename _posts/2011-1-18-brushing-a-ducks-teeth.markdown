I've always been lousy at introductions, so I'll get straight to the point. 

You see, coffee and I â€“ we sort of have a 'thing.' I confess. Well, it's really more of a lusty infatuation. I figure if we're going to keep spending this much time together, I should probably learn a thing or two about her. You know, so we have something to talk about _above_ the sheets.

I'll use this space to collect tasting notes and make snarky comments on the generally snobby coffee community. I won't, however, get into pedantic discussions over the precise pressure to pull a proper shot of espresso. 

But I probably will keep up the alliteration.
