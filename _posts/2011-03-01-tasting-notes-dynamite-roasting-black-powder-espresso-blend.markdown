[Dynamite Roasting][1] is a local organic roaster in Black Mountain, NC. I've written before about their Sumatra Mandheling roast–one of my favorite coffees. I recently had the chance to visit their coffee bar and pick up their [Black Powder Espresso Blend][2].

This dark roast has an intense coffee aroma with tones of cream and nut oil. As an espresso blend, the beans are roasted well into the second crack but don't suffer the common "roasted-to-hell" trait of many similar blends. There's no musky or meaty[^1] burnt smell here.

The flavor profile is extremely complex. Most pronounced is a smack of dark cocoa trailed by mild berry fruit notes and a hint of nut. The flavor is quite strong and rather dark, but remains balanced with no overwhelming elements. The finished cup has great body and a very smooth finish with fairly low acidity. Its flavor lingers and has a bit of bite.

And then there's the gorgeous copper crema. Heaps of the stuff. It's like pouring a pint of Guinness.

While at Dynamite's bar, I sampled a straight double shot and a double Americano. On a return trip, I tried another double Americano, but iced. Since then, I've been enjoying double Americanos at home from my AeroPress. This blend holds up. I can see it working well in any blended coffee drink.

Dynamite Roasting's Black Powder Espresso is–quite possibly–the best _espresso_ blend I've ever had. It's complex but balanced; both subtle and bold. As good as it is, I wouldn't want it every day since it's so bold. A solid 4 stars.
