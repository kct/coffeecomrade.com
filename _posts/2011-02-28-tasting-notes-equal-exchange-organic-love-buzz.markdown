Why do roasters produce "Vanlentine's Day" blends? Not that I'm complaining; the more roasts the better. I suppose the idea of blending beans is supposed to evoke images of the blending of souls. Whatever works.

Regardless, the love-themed roasts on shelves for the past month caught my eye, in particular [Equal Exchange's Organic Love Buzz][1]. It's a "post-roast" blend, meaning the beans are mixed after they've been fully roasted. This is a great blending method, especially for a darker roast. Mixing the beans before cooking tends to homogenize the flavor. Keeping them separate as they roast allows for a more interesting and defined taste in the finished product.

This blend has a distinctly pleasant and lightly sweet aroma more reminiscent of fruit than caramelized sugars.

As a finished cup, Love Buzz is both dark and creamy with a prominent malty hook. The flavor has a rich and deeply fruity foundation. Its profile is decently complex, and the faint astringency lends a cheerful note to its middle-of-the-road acidity.

The brew is a little thin in the mouth, and its aftertaste is fleeting. As the cup cools down, the flavor intensifies. This inspired me to try the roast cold-brewed. It's a solid drink prepared as an iced Americano, which speaks to its diversity.

What gets me about this roast is how I keep coming back. Granted, my local co-op ran a month-long sale on the blend for only $8.50 a pound. I've gone through two pounds of the stuff so far. Despite the bargain price tag, this is a commendable blend that brews into a great, drinkable cup. 4 stars.
