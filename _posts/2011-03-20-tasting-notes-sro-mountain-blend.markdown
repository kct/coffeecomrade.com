SRO, or "Shade Raised Organic" coffee is an enigma. No website, no contact info. Nothing. On their pre-bagged roasts, a small stamp indicates that G.A.S. Distribution of Leicester, NC has _something_ to do with SRO coffee. Do they roast it? Just rebrand white-labeled beans? I have no clue.

It's a shame the origin is such a mystery; Mountain Blend is seriously good coffee!

The aroma is sharp and peppery with traces of honey. It's a medium roast that benefits from perfect balance and solid body. It has a chocolatey character backed by subtle notes of raspberry and red wine.

The flavor is extremely bright and biting. It's a roast with teeth. The aftertaste has a lingering acidity that just invites sip after sip.

SRO also offers a roast from Costa Rica's La Hacienda Amistad, which may hint toward the producer's identity. It really is unfortunate that I can't find more information since I'd love to track down their other roasts. They obviously know what they're doing. 4 Stars.
