The International Coffee Organization's [latest monthly report (PDF)][1] is out and the news is still somewhat grim. They cite continued weather woes as the chief cause of low crop yields. Green coffee prices haven't been so high in over 15 years, and we've seen a 55% increase in the past twelve months. 

Chinese demand for coffee [grows about 20% annually][2], and India's market [gains a similar 20%][3] each year. As the two most populous nations in the world, their rapid growth rates spike global production demand. The impact is huge. Couple this with generally low supply and it's clear why we've been shelling out more at the checkout line.

In fact, one local store put up this little apology:

However, one positive note: this month Brazil reported a _reduction_ to biennial crop variations. Arabica beans follow a yearly low-yield/high-yield cycle. This decreased variation may be a result of improved agriculture. Might this combat the established two-year price floor on coffee futures? Too early to speculate, but it's interesting nonetheless.
