Would you drink coffee that had been, erm, "passed" through the bowels of a small mammal? Apparently some would. [Kopi Luwak][1] beans are produced when the horrifically cute [Asian Palm Civet][2] eats coffee berries and shoots out the seeds undigested.

It's really not as gross as it may seem at first glance. The roasting process easily kills anything unpleasant on the beans. What it won't kill is the price; Kopi Luwak coffee can set you back almost a grand per pound!

I've never had it, so I can't comment on the taste, but the recent increase in demand rings of foodie-ism run amok. While quality obviously _may_ drive demand, the two are not inexorably linked. 

What's interesting is the origin of this brew. The story goes that the Dutch who colonized Sumatra and established plantations prohibited local workers from keeping coffee for themselves. These farmers had to resort to picking the beans out of civet shit (that has a nice ring to it, eh?) in order to have a cup.

History is full of these pauper-to-connoisseur food stories. Lobster was once "junk" fish tossed to the deck hands; barbecue was born from attempts to improve scrap meats. Whipped meat–that from animals tortured to death–only [relatively recently fell out of vogue][3] in favor of free-range options.

Maybe Kopi Luwak truly is the pinnacle of mild, bitter-free brews. Or maybe it's just an indulgent luxury. I suppose you'll have to hunt down a $50 cup and try it yourself.

Me? I'm looking for a pet civet.
