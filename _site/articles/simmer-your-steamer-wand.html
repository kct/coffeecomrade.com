		<h2>Simmer Your Steamer Wand</h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m disturbed by the aggressive elitism of some coffee shops. I can dig an attitude or edginess; it can often set your shop apart and dictate the type of clientele you draw. But when your ethos becomes a thinly-veiled ego stroke, it&#8217;s time to chill down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I visited a shop that billed itself as an &#8220;espresso bar&#8221; rather than a coffee shop. Again, I can dig that. Ostensibly, it tells me that I can expect a higher level of service than a clerk filling my cup from an airpot<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. A friend had warned me that the owner was &#8221;<em>really</em> into his coffee,&#8221; but that only piqued my curiosity. I ordered my standard Americano (oddly, no option for a double).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll admit it was an expertly prepared Americano. I&#8217;ve lost count of the shops I&#8217;ve visited that flub up the order of preparation for a relatively straightforward drink. This shop had it down pat, using a vintage La Marzocca to pull a perfect shot. And it tasted pretty good to boot. But it wasn&#8217;t the <em>best tasting</em> I&#8217;ve had, despite the flawless preparation.</p>

<p>I asked the barista whose beans they were using. His response? &#8220;Just local organic beans.&#8221; Red flag. Why be so tight lipped about your product? If anything, you should be proud of your choice of roast, especially in an area with an abundance of fantastic and community-oriented roasters. No need to act like Mr. Slurm cornered you in an alley, there, Charlie.</p>

<p>When I got home, I pulled up the espresso bar&#8217;s website. In a contrived question/answer section, the owner&#8217;s position on flavored coffee drinks is to suggest the gas station down the road. While possibly funny, the response mirrored the general atmosphere of his shop. You are the consumer, I am the expert. No thanks.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s really no place for snobbery. Sure, I cringe at the thought of mixing a great shot of espresso with a bunch of industrial flavorings. You don&#8217;t, however, need to cast stones at those who don&#8217;t know the difference.</p>

<p>Take for example another local shop. A few months ago, I was waiting at the register when a woman stepped up with a puzzled look on her face. She stared down into her tall paper cup contemplating what she might be looking at. The barista offered his assistance and the woman said she&#8217;d ordered a machiatto but only received a small cup of &#8220;something&#8221; when she expected a full glass of mostly milk. Instead of chastising the woman for her ignorance to the terminology, the barista asked if she usually ordered machiattos from Starbucks and proceeded to explain the difference between their variation on a latte machiatto and a true caff√® machiatto. He did this while remaking her drink the way she expected.</p>

<p>The exchange left the customer seemingly happy and definitely more educated. Instead of a scolding, she walked away with a drink for which she knew the proper name and a more educated view of coffee drinks. She&#8217;ll probably return to the shop, or at least won&#8217;t write them off as pompous and condescending.</p>

<p>Loving your craft is great. When that love turns into a fetish indulging superiority complex, you&#8217;re being counterproductive. No one likes to feel patronized and that sort of stiff necked behavior only drives customers out of the specialty shops and back to the prosaic national chains.</p>

<p>At least they can expect a drink there rather than a glare.</p>

<p>As an aside, one of the best cups of coffee I&#8217;ve ever had came from an airpot.</p>
