Here's the source for my coffee blog. 

Everything is gussied-up into a static site via [Jekyll][1] with some help from the [jekyll_ext][2] wrapper and several [extensions][3].

My writing, photographs, graphics, and any other original content is covered by a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License][4]. In simple terms, you can reuse whatever you like from this site for non-commercial purposes, so long as you give me an attributive credit in the form of a link back to this site and _do not modify_ the work. I would also appreciate it if you [let me know][5] how and where you're using my work.

The design and layout of this site is not provided as a "theme" or ready-made package. Please, feel free to examine and learn from the techniques here, but don't just change the links or byline and call it your own.
