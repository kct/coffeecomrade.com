		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-dynamite-roasting-black-powder-espresso-blend.html">Tasting Notes - Dynamite Roasting - Black Powder Espresso Blend</a></h2>
		<p><a href='http://www.dynamiteroasting.com/'>Dynamite Roasting</a> is a local organic roaster in Black Mountain, NC. I&#8217;ve written before about their Sumatra Mandheling roast–one of my favorite coffees. I recently had the chance to visit their coffee bar and pick up their <a href='http://www.dynamiteroasting.com/onlinestore.html'>Black Powder Espresso Blend</a>.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-dynamite_-black-powder/dynamite-black-powder-bag.jpg' alt='Dynamite Roasting - Black Powder Espresso Blend' /></p>

<p>This dark roast has an intense coffee aroma with tones of cream and nut oil. As an espresso blend, the beans are roasted well into the second crack but don&#8217;t suffer the common &#8220;roasted-to-hell&#8221; trait of many similar blends. There&#8217;s no musky or meaty burnt smell here.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-dynamite_-black-powder/dynamite-black-powder-beans.jpg' alt='Dynamite Roasting - Black Powder Espresso Blend - Beans' /></p>

<p>The flavor profile is extremely complex. Most pronounced is a smack of dark cocoa trailed by mild berry fruit notes and a hint of nut. The flavor is quite strong and rather dark, but remains balanced with no overwhelming elements. The finished cup has great body and a very smooth finish with fairly low acidity. Its flavor lingers and has a bit of bite.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the gorgeous copper crema. Heaps of the stuff. It&#8217;s like pouring a pint of Guinness.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-dynamite_-black-powder/dynamite-black-powder-crema.jpg' alt='Dynamite Roasting - Black Powder Espresso Blend - Crema' /></p>

<p>While at Dynamite&#8217;s bar, I sampled a straight double shot and a double Americano. On a return trip, I tried another double Americano, but iced. Since then, I&#8217;ve been enjoying double Americanos at home from my AeroPress. This blend holds up. I can see it working well in any blended coffee drink.</p>

<p>Dynamite Roasting&#8217;s Black Powder Espresso is–quite possibly–the best <em>espresso</em> blend I&#8217;ve ever had. It&#8217;s complex but balanced; both subtle and bold. As good as it is, I wouldn&#8217;t want it every day since it&#8217;s so bold. A solid 4 stars.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/simmer-your-steamer-wand.html">Simmer Your Steamer Wand</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m disturbed by the aggressive elitism of some coffee shops. I can dig an attitude or edginess; it can often set your shop apart and dictate the type of clientele you draw. But when your ethos becomes a thinly-veiled ego stroke, it&#8217;s time to chill down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I visited a shop that billed itself as an &#8220;espresso bar&#8221; rather than a coffee shop. Again, I can dig that. Ostensibly, it tells me that I can expect a higher level of service than a clerk filling my cup from an airpot<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. A friend had warned me that the owner was &#8220;_really_ into his coffee,&#8221; but that only piqued my curiosity. I ordered my standard Americano (oddly, no option for a double).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll admit it was an expertly prepared Americano. I&#8217;ve lost count of the shops I&#8217;ve visited that flub up the order of preparation for a relatively straightforward drink. This shop had it down pat, using a vintage La Marzocca to pull a perfect shot. And it tasted pretty good to boot. But it wasn&#8217;t the <em>best tasting</em> I&#8217;ve had, despite the flawless preparation.</p>

<p>I asked the barista whose beans they were using. His response? &#8220;Just local organic beans.&#8221; Red flag. Why be so tight lipped about your product? If anything, you should be proud of your choice of roast, especially in an area with an abundance of fantastic and community-oriented roasters. No need to act like Mr. Slurm cornered you in an alley, there, Charlie.</p>

<p>When I got home, I pulled up the espresso bar&#8217;s website. In a contrived question/answer section, the owner&#8217;s position on flavored coffee drinks is to suggest the Exxon station down the road. While possibly funny, the response mirrored the general atmosphere of his shop. You are the consumer, I am the expert. No thanks.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s really no place for snobbery. Sure, I cringe at the thought of mixing a great shot of espresso with a bunch of industrial flavorings. You don&#8217;t, however, need to cast stones at those who don&#8217;t know the difference.</p>

<p>Take for example another local shop. A few months ago, I was waiting at the register when a woman stepped up with a puzzled look on her face. She stared down into her tall paper cup contemplating what she might be looking at. The barista offered his assistance and the woman said she&#8217;d ordered a machiatto but only received a small cup of &#8220;something&#8221; when she expected a full glass of mostly milk. Instead of chastising the woman for her ignorance to the terminology, the barista asked if she usually ordered machiattos from Starbucks and proceeded to explain the difference between their variation on a latte machiatto and a true caffè machiatto. He did this while remaking her drink the way she expected.</p>

<p>The exchange left the customer seemingly happy and definitely more educated. Instead of a scolding, she walked away with a drink for which she knew the proper name and a more educated view of coffee drinks. She&#8217;ll probably return to the shop, or at least won&#8217;t write them off as pompous and condescending.</p>

<p>Loving your craft is great. When that love turns into a fetish indulging superiority complex, you&#8217;re being counterproductive. No one likes to feel patronized and that sort of stiff necked behavior only drives customers out of the specialty shops and back to the prosaic national chains.</p>

<p>At least they can expect a drink there rather than a lecture and a scoff.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/demanding-price.html">Demanding Price</a></h2>
		<p>The International Coffee Organization&#8217;s <a href='http://www.ico.org/news/cmr-0111-e.pdf'>latest monthly report (PDF)</a> is out and the news is still somewhat grim. They cite continued weather woes as the chief cause of low crop yields. Green coffee prices haven&#8217;t been so high in over 15 years, and we&#8217;ve seen a 55% increase in the past twelve months.</p>

<p>Chinese demand for coffee <a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aq3ewkyLbKuc'>grows about 20% annually</a>, and India&#8217;s market <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-28/coffee-demand-in-india-to-drive-imports-board-s-rau-forecasts.html'>gains a similar 20%</a> each year. As the two most populous nations in the world, their rapid growth rates spike global production demand. The impact is huge. Couple this with generally low supply and it&#8217;s clear why we&#8217;ve been shelling out more at the checkout line.</p>

<p>In fact, one local store put up this little apology:</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/misc/demanding-price.jpg' alt='Supermarket Apology' /></p>

<p>However, one positive note: this month Brazil reported a <em>reduction</em> to biennial crop variations. Arabica beans follow a yearly low-yield/high-yield cycle. This decreased variation may be a result of improved agriculture. Might this combat the established two-year price floor on coffee futures? Too early to speculate, but it&#8217;s interesting nonetheless.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-pachamama-peru.html">Tasting Notes - Pachamama - Santa Teresa, Peru</a></h2>
		<p>This review is difficult to write. Difficult not only because I have to be harsh, but also because I feel like I&#8217;ve failed. I attempt to find a redeeming or commendable quality in just about every brew I try.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t find anything to like about <a href='http://www.pachamama.coop/detail.cfm?id=3930'>Pachamama&#8217;s Peruvian offering</a>. It&#8217;s just bad coffee.</p>

<p>It lacks aroma. The mouthfeel is indistinguishable from tepid water. The acidity is off the chart. Its flavor is simple and singular; but unfortunately that flavor is dirt. I&#8217;m not exaggerating, it tastes like dirt. Or, more specifically, dirt-laden coffee bean skins (chaff).</p>

<p>My typical review process is to brew and drink several cups over a few days, making notes each time. When I sit down to write the review, I&#8217;ll brew up another cup and go over my previous notes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting here drinking my third cup of this monstrosity and my opinion hasn&#8217;t changed. The nuance that usually reveals itself after repeated tastings is completely absent. I hate this bean.</p>

<p>The things I do for you people.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-equal-exchange-organic-midnight-sun.html">Tasting Notes - Equal Exchange's Organic Midnight Sun</a></h2>
		<p>I Grabbed this <a href='http://shop.equalexchange.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=10032'>dark roast from Equal Exchange</a> at the local co-op on sale.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun/equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun_-beans.jpg' alt='Equal Exchange - Organic Midnight Sun - Beans' /></p>

<p>Look at how oily these suckers are! They&#8217;re practically dripping.</p>

<p>Brewed in my small Chemex, the finished product was decent, but lacking; so I moved on to the AeroPress. Using two tablespoons of beans–finely ground–produced a very tasty cup!</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun/equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun_-crema.jpg' alt='Equal Exchange - Organic Midnight Sun - Crema' /></p>

<p>The aroma is thick with syrup, almost malty. The flavor is quite rich with absolutely no notes of fruit and a very heavy, bold coffee flavor. Its taste is rather simple. It feels heavy in the mouth with very low acidity. The crema is creamy and rich with oil. As I often experience–quite enjoyably–with dark roasts there is a subtle coconut aftertaste mixed with dark chocolate.</p>

<p>Midnight Sun is drinkable despite its fairly modest complexity. It lingers on the tongue <em>slighty</em> too long and tastes exclusively of coffee. The flavor lacks nuance, as is common with the darkest roasts, but this is disappointing only if you&#8217;re expecting a diverse flavor profile. This roast won&#8217;t grab everyone, but those who enjoy their drink bold will find something to like.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun/equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun_-cup.jpg' alt='Equal Exchange - Organic Midnight Sun - Finished Cup' /></p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Recommended <em>only</em> if you <em>really</em> like dark roasts. 2 Stars.</p>
